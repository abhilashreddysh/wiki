# The Knowledge Hub

This is my personal **Knowledge Hub** — a place where I jot down everything about my homelab, infrastructure experiments, and projects.

- Quick notes, configs, and scripts I use.
- Problems I run into (so I don’t have to solve them twice).
- Random experiments, trials, and lessons learned along the way.

!!! warning "_Mostly refers to my setup and understanding, but if it helps someone else, great! Explore and see what I’ve been building and learning._"
